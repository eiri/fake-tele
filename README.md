_A fake telemetry MQTT client_

![test](https://github.com/eiri/fake-tele/workflows/test/badge.svg)

## Description and motivation

This is an erlang app that creates a network of MQTT clients reporting randomly generated telemetry to a broker.

The propose of the app is to simulate traffic for testing of a MQTT broker.

## Build

```
$ brew install rebar3
$ rebar3 compile
```

## Run

### Start server

_This assumes that docker is available, up and running_

```
$ make server-start
make server-start
docker-compose up -d

### Create grafana dashboard

Open http://localhost:3000. Login as `admin:admin`. Add data source `InfluxDB` with name "InfluxDB", `url` http://influxdb:8086 and database "fake-tele".

Go to "Home" (in page header), choose sub-menu "Import dashboard" and upload or paste json from `infra/grafana-dashboard.json`.

Go to created dashboard "MQTT".

### Stop servers

```
$ make server-stop
docker-compose down
Stopping grafana   ... done
Stopping mosquitto ... done
Stopping influxdb  ... done
Removing grafana   ... done
Removing mosquitto ... done
Removing influxdb  ... done
Removing network fake-tele_default
```
